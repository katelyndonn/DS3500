### Abstract

Stock price changes can be attributed to systematic and unsystematic factors. On an individual level, changes in stock prices reflect shifts in a company's health or reputation. On an aggregated industry level, changes in stock prices reflect an industryâ€™s susceptibility to macroeconomic factors. Spotting trends across industries show which industries are correlated to each other, and a well-diversified stock portfolio minimizes investor risk by including stocks with little correlation. There are already existing ETFs which model the S&P 500 that investors can buy, but our analysis will show trends among entire industries which can (hopefully) apply to any stock outside the S&P 500. As the S&P 500 represents the 500 largest companies on the US stock exchanges, it is a good indicator of large-cap market health. Analyzing historical stock data will allow us to build a strong understanding of this market, predict future prices, and make investment recommendations. 


### Project Goals

Our overall goal is to build an interactive dashboard which depicts different features of individual stocks and entire industry sectors for comparison over a user-specified window of time. We plan to use the plotly dash library to accomplish our end product. To better design the dashboard for user navigation and experience, we plan on styling the HTML features by utilizing CSS and Dash Bootstrap Components. We also intend to incorporate modularity into our project by building a reusable class that will read stock data from a csv file since we have 500 stocks to analyze. The dashboard will implement numerous user controls including the selection of specific industries, companies, or metrics to filter the data; some examples of these metrics are the market cap, stock price over time, stock volume, and more.
